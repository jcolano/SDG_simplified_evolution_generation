# Simplified Evolution Generation Using LLMs

"""
## Introduction

This script provides a simplified approach to understanding how the RAGAS framework generates and validates question evolutions using a Language Learning Model (LLM) such as GPT-3.5. The code demonstrates the core components of RAGAS's methodology: generating initial questions from a text corpus, evolving these questions into more complex forms, and using a critic function to ensure the evolved questions meet specific criteria. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this script is to simulate the key processes involved in RAGAS's synthetic data generation pipeline, which is used to create diverse and challenging datasets for training and evaluating language models. This simplified version uses Python and GPT-3.5 to replicate the following steps:

1. **Document Chunking:** Splits a given document into manageable chunks of text to focus on specific parts of the content.
2. **Question Generation:** Uses an LLM to generate simple, factual questions based on each chunk of the document.
3. **Applying Evolutions:** Transforms the simple questions into more complex forms (e.g., multi-step reasoning, compressed, or rephrased questions) using the LLM.
4. **Critic Validation:** Employs a critic function, also powered by the LLM, to evaluate whether the evolved questions are valid. The critic checks if the evolved questions are sufficiently different from the originals while maintaining the same meaning.

### Workflow

The workflow of the script is divided into distinct steps:

1. **Initialization:** The script initializes an instance of the `EvolutionGenerator` class, which handles communication with the LLM and manages the evolution process.
2. **Document Chunking:** The input document is split into smaller text chunks. This mimics the approach of breaking down a large corpus into smaller, manageable pieces that can be processed individually.
3. **Simple Question Generation:** For each text chunk, a simple question is generated using the `gpt()` function. This step highlights how initial, straightforward questions are created from raw text.
4. **Applying Evolutions:** The script applies three different types of evolutions to each simple questionâ€”complexity, compression, and rephrasing. These transformations are designed to increase the difficulty and variety of the questions, similar to how RAGAS would produce varied data points for model training.
5. **Critic Evaluation:** After generating the evolved questions, the script uses the critic function to validate each evolution. The critic ensures that the transformations meet the criteria of being sufficiently distinct from the original while preserving the core intent and meaning.
6. **Validation Output:** The script provides detailed feedback on the validity of each evolved question, helping users understand the decision-making process of the critic.

### Conclusion

This script provides a hands-on, simplified example of RAGAS's approach to generating synthetic data through question evolutions and validation. By understanding these key concepts, users can appreciate the importance of diverse and high-quality training data in building robust and capable language models.

Note: This script requires an active OpenAI client with access to GPT
